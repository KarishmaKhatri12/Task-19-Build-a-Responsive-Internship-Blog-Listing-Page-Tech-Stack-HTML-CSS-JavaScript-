    <p>The tech world is evolving faster than ever, and 2025 will bring even more opportunities for skilled professionals. Whether you're a student, job seeker, or professional, here are the top 5 tech skills you should master in 2025.</p>

    <h2>1. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>AI is no longer a future trend—it's the present. From chatbots to predictive analytics, AI and ML are being integrated into every industry. Learn tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn to stay ahead.</p>
    <p>Real-world applications include AI-powered customer support, recommendation systems (like Netflix or Amazon), fraud detection in banking, and autonomous vehicles.</p>

    <h2>2. Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)</h2>
    <p>With businesses shifting to cloud infrastructure, skills in AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform are highly in demand. Cloud experts manage servers, deploy applications, and secure data at scale.</p>
    <p>Certifications like AWS Certified Solutions Architect or Azure Fundamentals can give you an edge.</p>

    <h2>3. Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>As cyber-attacks rise, companies are investing in data protection more than ever. Skills in network security, ethical hacking, and risk analysis are critical. Learn tools like Wireshark, Kali Linux, and security frameworks.</p>
    <p>Cybersecurity professionals are among the highest paid tech workers in 2025 due to rising demand.</p>

    <h2>4. DevOps & Automation</h2>
    <p>DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations. Knowing CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and automation scripting (like Bash, PowerShell) is essential.</p>
    <p>Companies value people who can make deployment faster, more reliable, and scalable.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Analytics & Visualization</h2>
    <p>Data is the new oil—but only if you can refine it. Data analysts help make data-driven decisions using tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.</p>
    <p>In 2025, every company needs insights to compete—so this skill will remain in high demand.</p>

    <p><strong>Bonus Tips:</strong> Keep an eye on emerging fields like Quantum Computing, Blockchain, and Augmented Reality. Tech never stops growing!</p>
