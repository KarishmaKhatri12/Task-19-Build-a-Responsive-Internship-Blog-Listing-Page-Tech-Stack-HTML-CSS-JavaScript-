    <p>Starting my internship was like stepping into a new chapter. I was both excited and nervous—what would my teammates be like? Would I understand the tasks? How different would it be from my university life? Spoiler alert: It was amazing!</p>

    <h2>Day 1: Orientation & First Impressions</h2>
    <p>The first day started with a virtual welcome session. We were introduced to the company culture, team hierarchy, and the tech stack. The HR team did a great job making us feel comfortable. I was relieved to know that other interns were just as curious and unsure as I was.</p>
    <p>After setting up my work tools like GitHub, Slack, and VS Code, I had a quick one-on-one with my mentor. She gave me an overview of what I’d be doing—mainly working on frontend modules for a client website. It felt so real and exciting!</p>

    <h2>Day 2–3: Technical Training</h2>
    <p>These two days were packed with training sessions. We covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics, Git commands, and how to push/pull from repositories. One of the sessions was on writing clean code, and I learned how to format my code better using tools like Prettier.</p>
    <p>Our team leads also showed us how to use Trello for project management. Tasks were assigned as cards, and we learned how to track our progress, communicate blockers, and manage deadlines efficiently.</p>

    <h2>Day 4: Assigned My First Task</h2>
    <p>I was officially assigned my first task: building a responsive “About Us” page using HTML and CSS. I had to follow the design mockup, use proper layout techniques, and ensure mobile responsiveness. It took me 6 hours, and I got stuck a few times—but I learned a lot!</p>
    <p>I submitted my work via a pull request on GitHub. The code was reviewed by a senior developer who suggested improvements and encouraged me to comment my code better. It was my first exposure to code reviews, and I realized how important feedback is.</p>

    <h2>Day 5: Daily Stand-Up & Reflections</h2>
    <p>We had our first daily stand-up meeting on Zoom, where every intern shared what they had done and what they were planning to work on. I was nervous, but the team was supportive and even cracked jokes to lighten the mood.</p>
    <p>I also had a feedback call with my mentor. She appreciated my commitment and encouraged me to take initiative. We discussed upcoming tasks, including working on JavaScript-based modals and improving page accessibility. I felt motivated to do better.</p>

    <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding Git commands initially—it was confusing at first</li>
      <li>Time management while switching between tutorials and tasks</li>
      <li>Making designs fully responsive across all screen sizes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic and intermediate Git usage (clone, push, pull, merge)</li>
      <li>How frontend and backend developers collaborate</li>
      <li>The power of good documentation and readable code</li>
      <li>Importance of asking for help instead of staying stuck</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Thoughts Going Forward</h2>
    <p>In just one week, I’ve learned so much—not just technically, but professionally too. I’ve seen how a real team operates, how to plan tasks, and how to seek feedback. More than anything, I feel inspired to keep growing. I’m looking forward to contributing more and maybe even leading a task someday!</p>
    <p>If you’re starting an internship soon, here’s my advice: be open to learning, never hesitate to ask questions, and stay organized. You’ll do great!</p>
